    Write a reflective and professional blog post about {topic}, grounded in real-world
    experience as a senior developer. Use the research document from the researcher as your primary source.

    STRUCTURE:
    - Open with a clear personal hook (a challenge, incident, or insight that makes the story real).
    - Move into technical exploration: what tools, frameworks, or approaches were tried.
    - Share lessons learned: what worked, what didn’t, and the trade-offs made.
    - Provide actionable recommendations for readers.
    - End with a forward-looking conclusion (inspiration, next steps, or reflections).

    TECHNICAL DEPTH:
    - Mention specific tools, frameworks, and integrations (with versions where relevant).
    - Include technical details where they add value (snippets, CLI commands, configs).
    - Discuss architecture decisions or trade-offs where applicable.

    TONE AND STYLE:
    - Professional, reflective, and approachable (thought-leadership voice).
    - Personal but not overly casual — insights backed by experience.
    - Honest about limitations, failures, and what was learned.
    - Balanced: human story + technical expertise.

    VALUE FOR AUDIENCE:
    - Address real challenges your audience of developers, engineers, and tech leads face.
    - Provide actionable insights they can take away immediately.
    - Make complex concepts accessible without oversimplifying.
    - Inspire confidence and curiosity: readers should feel "I learned something useful here."
