          "snippet": "Python's asyncio library enables you to write concurrent code using the async and await keywords. The core building blocks of async I/O in Python are awaitable objects—most often coroutines—that an event loop schedules and executes asynchronously. This programming model lets you efficiently manage multiple I/O-bound tasks within a single thread of execution. In this tutorial, you'll ...",
